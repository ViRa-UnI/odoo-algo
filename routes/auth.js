```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Register route
router.post('/register', (req, res) => {
  // Implement registration logic here
});

// Login route
router.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  // Implement login logic here
});

// Logout route
router.get('/logout', (req, res) => {
  // Implement logout logic here
});

module.exports = router;
```
This is the code for the file `routes/auth.js` in a MERN stack gambling website. It sets up the routes for user authentication, including registration, login, and logout.

To incorporate this code into your local development server, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `auth.js` in the `routes` directory of your project.
2. Copy the generated code and paste it into the `auth.js` file.
3. Save the file.
4. In the main server file (e.g., `server.js`), import the `auth` router by adding the following line of code:
   ```javascript
   const authRouter = require('./routes/auth');
   ```
5. Mount the `auth` router by adding the following line of code after creating the Express app:
   ```javascript
   app.use('/api/auth', authRouter);
   ```
   This will make the authentication routes accessible at `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`, and `/api/auth/logout`.

Make sure to install the necessary dependencies (`express`, `mongoose`, etc.) and set up the database connection before running the server.
