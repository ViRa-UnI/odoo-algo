```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Placeholder route for getting all bets
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Get all bets');
});

// Placeholder route for getting a specific bet
router.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  res.send(`Get bet with id ${id}`);
});

// Placeholder route for creating a new bet
router.post('/', (req, res) => {
  const { body } = req;
  res.send(`Create new bet: ${JSON.stringify(body)}`);
});

// Placeholder route for updating a bet
router.put('/:id', (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const { body } = req;
  res.send(`Update bet with id ${id}: ${JSON.stringify(body)}`);
});

// Placeholder route for deleting a bet
router.delete('/:id', (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  res.send(`Delete bet with id ${id}`);
});

module.exports = router;
```
This is the code for the `routes/bets.js` file. It sets up the routes for handling HTTP requests related to bets in the gambling website. 

The code defines several placeholder routes:
- The `GET /` route is for getting all bets.
- The `GET /:id` route is for getting a specific bet by its ID.
- The `POST /` route is for creating a new bet.
- The `PUT /:id` route is for updating a bet by its ID.
- The `DELETE /:id` route is for deleting a bet by its ID.

Each route has a placeholder implementation that sends a response with a corresponding message. You can replace these placeholder implementations with your actual logic for handling bets in the gambling website.

To incorporate this code into your local development server, you need to create a `routes` directory in your project's root directory if it doesn't already exist. Then, create a file named `bets.js` inside the `routes` directory and copy the generated code into it. Finally, make sure to import and use this `bets.js` file in your main server file (e.g., `server.js`) to enable the defined routes.

Remember to install the necessary dependencies (such as Express) using npm or yarn before running your local development server.
